Give examples
Allison wants to have more sophisticated activities for herself and her friends, and using Omniscient Aerator, she plans for a new book club.  Providing the food she wants to serve, she's given the ideal types of wine to match, she's directed to various brands that are available, and she's provided a book, that is related to the wine, from the New York Times Best Seller List for the group, to read for their new book club.

Bobby and Carol wants to have more fulfilling activities with each other.  
Carol has always been a fantastic chef, so Bobby, knowing what she'll be making, logs into the site, and is given the literature and wine to supplement their nights.
The results are saved in his account, so they can keep having new experiences together.

# Project Two - Omniscient Aerator

This app was created to advise people which wines best pair with their foods, and to provide a book that is related to the wine.  The app prompts for the food, and acts as a sommelier, providing types of wines, and accompanying subsets of those wines.

Walmart's wine selection is then searched for matching examples of the subtypes chosen, and the New York Times's Best Seller List is searched for books that have words in their description that are similar to the chosen wines.

In the users' account history, their meals, wine types, brands of specific wine, and their book selections are saved to compare for future experiences.
