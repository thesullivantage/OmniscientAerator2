5. What is your MVP? Remember the MVP is the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials. 
    ## Here is our MVP:
    1. Create Account w/ age validation
    2. Main Search based on what dish user is eating
    3. Results grabbed from database (which we make -- 3 tables)
    4. Then, a page to rate wines based on a search, and see what wines rated, along with profile info


    Alec: Front end stuff
    Daniel: Store User Info/History/ Validation
    Michael: Data collection, search apis
    Kyle: Wine-food Match (ICEBOX: )
    
    USER STORIES:
    Kyle: "As a user, I want to find the wine to pair with my food & book to pair with wine."
    
    Alec: "As a user I want to have a nice simple interface thats easy to navigate"

    Michael: "I want to be shown the wine reccomended, examples/varieties of it, and books that go with the wine"

    Daniel: "As a user, I want to be able to create and view my account and view my saved information"
